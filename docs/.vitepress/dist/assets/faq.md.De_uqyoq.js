Please check the following:</p><ol><li><strong>Is the Campaign Active?</strong> Go to the &quot;All Campaigns&quot; page and ensure the campaign&#39;s status is <code>Active</code>, not <code>Inactive</code> or <code>Expired</code>.</li><li><strong>Is the Schedule Correct?</strong> If the campaign is <code>Scheduled</code>, make sure the current date and time are within the Start and End dates you have set. Remember that all times are based on your WordPress timezone setting.</li><li><strong>Is the Product Targeted Correctly?</strong> Double-check the &quot;Discount Target&quot; settings in your campaign. If it&#39;s targeted to a specific product or category, ensure the product you are viewing is included in that target group.</li><li><strong>Is &quot;Exclude Sale Items&quot; Enabled?</strong> Go to <strong>Settings → Product Settings</strong>. If &quot;Automatically Exclude Sale Items&quot; is checked, your campaign discount will not apply to any product that already has a native WooCommerce sale price.</li></ol><h3 id="why-did-my-scheduled-campaign-not-start-on-time" tabindex="-1">Why did my scheduled campaign not start on time? <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-did-my-scheduled-campaign-not-start-on-time" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Why did my scheduled campaign not start on time?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>CampaignBay relies on a WordPress system called WP-Cron to automate schedules. On low-traffic websites, WP-Cron may not be triggered at the exact moment a campaign is due to start.</p><p>Our plugin has a <strong>built-in failsafe</strong> that manually checks and corrects campaign statuses periodically, so your campaign should activate shortly after the scheduled time once your site receives a visitor. For mission-critical sales, we recommend setting up a server-level cron job for maximum reliability.</p><p><a href="./core-concepts/scheduling-and-automation.html">Learn more about Scheduling &amp; Automation here.</a></p><h3 id="can-i-use-campaignbay-discounts-with-a-woocommerce-coupon" tabindex="-1">Can I use CampaignBay discounts with a WooCommerce coupon? <a class="header-anchor" href="#can-i-use-campaignbay-discounts-with-a-woocommerce-coupon" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Can I use CampaignBay discounts with a WooCommerce coupon?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Yes, but it is controlled by a global setting.</p><ul><li>Navigate to <strong>Settings → Cart Settings</strong>.</li><li>If <strong>&quot;Allow Stacking with WooCommerce Coupons&quot;</strong> is enabled, both discount types can be used together.</li><li>If it is disabled, they are mutually exclusive.

When you target a variable product (either by selecting it directly or through its category/tag), the discount will be available for <strong>all of its variations</strong>. When a customer selects a variation on the product page, the price will update to show the campaign discount if one applies.</p><h3 id="will-this-plugin-slow-down-my-site" tabindex="-1">Will this plugin slow down my site? <a class="header-anchor" href="#will-this-plugin-slow-down-my-site" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Will this plugin slow down my site?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>CampaignBay has been built with performance in mind. On the frontend, it uses a multi-level caching system (transients) to store the list of active campaigns. This means it only needs to query the database for campaigns periodically, not on every page load, ensuring a fast experience for your customers. You can manage the cache from the <strong>Settings → Global Settings</strong> tab.</p>',16)]))}const p=t(s,[["render",n]]);export{m as __pageData,p as default};
