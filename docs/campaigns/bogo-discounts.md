# BOGO (Buy X, Get Y) Discounts

## What is a BOGO Discount?

A "Buy X, Get Y" (BOGO) discount is a versatile promotion that allows you to create offers where purchasing certain products unlocks a discount on other products. For simplicity in this version, the "Get" product is always made **free**.

You can create classic deals like "Buy one, get one free" or more complex offers like "Buy any two large items, get a small item for free."
