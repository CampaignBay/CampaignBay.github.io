# Earlybird Discounts

## What is an Earlybird Discount?

An Earlybird Discount is a powerful tool for creating urgency. It offers a special, often deeper, discount to a limited number of the first customers who make a purchase.

This campaign works by tracking the number of **orders** that have used the campaign, not the total quantity of products sold. This ensures the promotion is fair and prevents one large customer from ending the sale for everyone else.

This campaign type, along with Scheduled Discounts, is considered a **"Simple Discount"** when it comes to stacking and priority.

## How to Create an Earlybird Discount

1.  Navigate to **Campaigns > Add Campaign**.
2.  From the **Select Discount Type** dropdown, choose **Earlybird Discount**.
3.  Enter a **Campaign Title**.
4.  Use the **Select for Users** dropdown to choose which products to target.
5.  In the **Discount Tiers for First Sales** section, define your tiers:
    -   **For First X Sales:** Enter the number of orders this tier applies to (e.g., `10`). The first tier might be for sales 1-10, the next for 11-20, etc.
    -   **give Y % / $:** Enter the discount value for that tier.
6.  Set the **Campaign Duration**.
7.  Click **Save Campaign**.
