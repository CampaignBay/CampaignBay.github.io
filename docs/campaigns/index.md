# All Campaigns

The "All Campaigns" page is your central hub for managing and organizing all the discount campaigns you create. From this screen, you can view, filter, sort, and perform actions on your campaigns using either a detailed Table View or a more visual Grid View.

### Page Header

The header provides the page title and primary actions for creating and managing campaigns.

- **Import / Export:** These buttons open a modal window for bulk importing and exporting campaigns.
- **Add Campaign +:** This button will take you to the "Add Campaign" screen, where you can create a new discount from scratch.

## Filtering and Searching

A powerful set of tools is available to help you find specific campaigns quickly.

1.  **Bulk Actions:** This dropdown allows you to perform an action on multiple campaigns at once.

    - **How to use:** First, select the campaigns you want to modify using the checkboxes. Then, choose an action (`Activate`, `Deactivate`, or `Delete`) from this dropdown. Finally, click the **Apply** button to execute the action. A confirmation will be required for destructive actions like deleting.

2.  **Filter by Status & Filter by Type:** Use these dropdowns to narrow down the list of visible campaigns. You can filter by status (`Active`, `Inactive`, etc.) or by campaign type (`Scheduled`, `Quantity`, etc.). After making your selections, click the **Apply** button to see the filtered results.

3.  **View Toggle:** Switch between the detailed **Table View** and the visual **Grid View**. This setting is automatically saved for your next visit.

4.  **Search Campaign:** This is an instant search field. Simply start typing a campaign's name, and the list will update in real-time to show you matching results.

## Table View

The Table View provides a dense, data-rich overview of all your campaigns, with sortable columns for easy organization.
