# Introduction to Campaigns

A "Campaign" is a set of rules that defines a specific discount or promotion. While the details of each campaign type are different, they all share a few common settings.

## Common Campaign Fields

-   **Campaign Title:** A name for your internal reference (e.g., "Black Friday 2025 Sale").
-   **Select for Users (Targeting):** This determines which products are eligible for the discount. You can apply campaigns to:
    -   The **Entire Store**.
    -   Specific **Product Categories**.
    -   Specific **Products**.
    -   Specific **Tags**.
-   **Select Campaign Duration:** The start and end date/time for your campaign.
