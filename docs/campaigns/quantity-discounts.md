# Quantity Based Discounts

## What is a Quantity Discount?

A Quantity Discount (also known as tiered or bulk pricing) rewards customers for purchasing larger quantities of a single product. The discount per item increases as the quantity in the cart reaches certain thresholds.

> **Important Note:** When using a **fixed currency** discount (e.g., "$5 off"), the discount is applied to **each individual item** in the cart that qualifies for the tier. It is not a one-time discount off the subtotal.

## How to Create a Quantity Discount

1.  Navigate to **Campaigns > Add Campaign**.
2.  From the **Select Discount Type** dropdown, choose **Quantity Based Discount**.
3.  Enter a **Campaign Title**.
4.  Use the **Select for Users** dropdown to choose which products to target.
5.  In the **Define Quantity Tiers** section, define your tiers:
    -   **Buy from X to Y Items, get Z % / $:** Enter the minimum and maximum quantity for the tier and the discount value.
    -   Click **Add another tier** to create more pricing levels.
6.  Set the **Campaign Duration**.
7.  Click **Save Campaign**.
