# Scheduled Discounts

## What is a Scheduled Discount?

A Scheduled Discount is the most common type of sale. It applies a simple percentage or fixed amount discount to eligible products for a specific period of time. It's perfect for seasonal sales, holiday promotions, or flash sales.

This campaign type, along with Earlybird Discounts, is considered a **"Simple Discount"** when it comes to stacking and priority.
