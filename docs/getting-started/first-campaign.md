# Creating Your First Campaign

This guide provides a detailed, step-by-step walkthrough for creating the most common type of discount: a simple **Scheduled Discount**. We will create a "20% Off Weekend Sale" to demonstrate the core workflow of CampaignBay.

## 1. Navigate to Add Campaign

In your WordPress admin menu, find the main **Campaigns** item. Click on it, and then select **Add Campaign**. This will take you to the main campaign editor screen where you will configure all your discounts.

## 2. Select the Campaign Type

This is the most important setting, as it defines how your discount will behave. Click on the **"SELECT DISCOUNT TYPE"** dropdown menu. For this tutorial, select the **"Scheduled Discount"** option.

## 3. Set the Campaign Title

In the **"CAMPAIGN TITLE"** field, give your campaign a clear and descriptive name. This title is important because it will be shown to customers in the cart totals section, so make it something they will understand, like `Weekend Sale`.

## 4. Choose the Target

The **"SELECT FOR USERS"** field determines which products are eligible for the discount. For this first campaign, we want to apply the discount to everything. Ensure that **"Entire Store"** is selected.

## 5. Define the Discount Value

In this section, you will set the amount of the discount.
1.  In the input field, type `20`.
2.  Ensure the **`%`** button next to the field is highlighted and blue. This sets the discount type to a percentage.

This configures a 20% discount.

## 6. Set the Schedule

Because this is a "Scheduled Discount," you must provide a start and end date. The campaign will only be active during this period.

1.  **Start Time / Date:** Click the time and date fields to open the pickers. Select the date and time you want the sale to begin (e.g., Friday at 12:01 AM).
2.  **End Time / Date:** Select the date and time you want the sale to end (e.g., Sunday at 11:59 PM).

The schedule will run based on the timezone you have set in your main WordPress settings (`Settings > General`).

## 7. Save the Campaign

Once all your settings are configured, click the blue **"Save Campaign"** button located at the top right of the page.

## 8. Verify the Campaign

After saving, you will be automatically redirected to the "All Campaigns" list. You should see your new "Weekend Sale" campaign at the top of the table.

Because its start date is in the future, its status will be a yellow **"Scheduled"** pill. This confirms that the system has correctly saved and scheduled your campaign.
