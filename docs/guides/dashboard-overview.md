# Dashboard Overview

The CampaignBay Dashboard is your mission control for all discount-related activities. It's designed to give you a high-level, scannable overview of your campaign performance and a direct line to immediate actions.

The dashboard is broken down into three main sections: Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), Performance Trends, and Actionable Insights.

## 1. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

This top section provides four key metrics to quickly assess the health and impact of your campaigns over the last 30 days. The percentage change shown is a comparison to the previous 30-day period.

-   **Active Campaigns:** A simple count of campaigns that are currently live and applying discounts on your store.
-   **Total Discount Value:** The total monetary value of all discounts applied through your campaigns. This shows you exactly how much value you've given to customers.
-   **Discounted Orders:** The total number of individual orders that have had at least one CampaignBay discount applied.
-   **Sales from Campaigns:** The total revenue (including product price, shipping, and taxes) generated from orders that included a campaign discount.

## 2. Performance Trends

This section helps you visualize your performance over time. You can use the dropdown on the right to change the time period for the charts (e.g., Last 7 Days, Last 30 Days, This Year).

-   **Discount Value Trends (Line Chart):** This chart shows you the total discount value given out each day. It's perfect for spotting trends and seeing the immediate impact of a new sale.
-   **Most Impactful Types (Pie Chart):** This strategic chart shows which **type** of campaign (e.g., Quantity vs. Scheduled) is generating the most sales revenue for your store, helping you decide which promotions are most effective.

## 3. Actionable Insights

This final section provides real-time information and allows you to take immediate action without leaving the dashboard.

-   **Live & Upcoming Campaigns:**
    -   *Currently Active:* A list of all campaigns currently running on your site. The **toggle switch** next to each one is a quick way to instantly activate or deactivate a campaign.
    -   *Starting Soon:* A list of your next few scheduled campaigns, so you can always see what's on the horizon.
-   **Recent Activity:** A log of the most recent administrative actions taken on your campaigns (e.g., created, updated, activated). Each entry includes who made the change and when, with a quick link to edit the campaign directly.
