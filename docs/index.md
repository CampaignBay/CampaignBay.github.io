## What is CampaignBay?

Welcome to the official documentation for CampaignBay!

CampaignBay is a powerful, user-friendly marketing tool that empowers you to create sophisticated, automated discount campaigns directly from your WordPress dashboard. Whether you're running a Black Friday flash sale, rewarding customers for bulk purchases, or creating urgency with a limited-time offer, CampaignBay provides the robust features you need to drive sales and engage customers.

With its intuitive dashboard, flexible campaign types, and high-performance discount engine, you get unparalleled control over your marketing strategy without sacrificing site speed.

This documentation will guide you through every feature, from installing the plugin to understanding the advanced settings.

## Key Features

- **Multiple Campaign Types:** Create classic **Scheduled Sales**, tiered **Quantity Discounts**, urgency-driven **Early Bird** offers, and popular **BOGO (Buy X Get X)** deals.
- **Advanced Analytics Dashboard:** Get an instant, data-rich overview of your campaign performance. Track total discount value, sales from campaigns, and discounted orders with interactive charts.
- **Flexible Targeting:** Apply discounts to your entire store, specific products, or categories, with powerful exclusion rules for precise control.
- **User Role Targeting:** Limit campaigns to specific user roles (e.g., Wholesale Customers, VIPs) using our new Condition engine.

## Use Cases

CampaignBay is designed to help you achieve specific business goals. Here are just a few examples of what you can build:

- **Launch New Products with a Bang:** Create an **Early Bird Discount** offering a steep discount to the first 50 customers to generate instant buzz and social proof.

- **Increase Average Order Value (AOV):** Implement a tiered **Quantity Discount** like "Buy 3+, get 10% off; Buy 5+, get 20% off" and use the built-in cart notices to encourage customers to add more to their cart.

- **Run Holiday Flash Sales:** Set up a **Scheduled Discount** for your entire store that automatically starts at midnight on Black Friday and ends precisely on Cyber Monday.

- **Clear Out Old Inventory:** Run a "Buy 2, Get 1 Free" **BOGO Campaign** on last season's styles to quickly move stock without devaluing your brand.

- **Create Simple Wholesale Tiers:** Use **Quantity Discounts** on specific product categories to offer wholesale-style pricing to all your customers without needing a separate plugin.
