## Global Settings

The "Global Settings" tab contains the main operational controls for the entire plugin, affecting how discounts are calculated and displayed across your store.

![Global Settings Tab](./public/settings-global.png)

### Global Options

#### Enable Discount Add-on

This is the master "on/off" switch for CampaignBay.

- **ON (Toggled Right):** The plugin is active and will apply discounts to your store.
- **OFF (Toggled Left):** The entire pricing engine is disabled. No discounts will be calculated or applied. This is a safe way to temporarily pause all campaigns at once without deactivating the plugin.

#### Bulk Table Position

This setting controls the default location on the product page where the "Quantity Discount" table is displayed.

![Bulk Table Position Options](./public/settings-bulk-table-position.png)

- **Below Cart:** Places the table directly below the "Add to Cart" button section.
- **Above Cart:** Places the table directly above the "Add to Cart" button section.
- **Below Meta:** Places the table below the product metadata (e.g., categories, tags, SKU).
- **Above Meta:** Places the table above the product metadata.

#### Discount Bar Position

This setting controls the default location for any promotional bars generated by your campaigns.

- **Below Cart:** Places the bar directly below the "Add to Cart" button section.
- **Above Cart:** Places the bar directly above the "Add to Cart" button section.
- **Below Meta:** Places the bar below the product metadata (e.g., categories, tags, SKU).
- **Above Meta:** Places the bar above the product metadata.

#### Calculate Discount From

This is a crucial setting that tells the plugin which price to use as the starting point for its calculations.

![Calculate Discount From Options](./public/settings-calculate-from.png)

- **Sale Price (Default):** If a product is already on sale in WooCommerce, CampaignBay will calculate its discount based on that lower **sale price**. This prevents discount stacking and gives the customer the final price based on the already reduced value.
- **Regular Price:** The campaign will always ignore the WooCommerce sale price and calculate its discount based on the original **regular price**.

### Performance & Caching

- **Enable Discount Caching:** This option is **highly recommended**. It stores active campaign rules in a temporary cache, which dramatically improves your store's performance by reducing database queries on every page load.
- **Clear Discount Cache:** Click this button to manually clear all cached campaign data. This is useful for troubleshooting if a change doesn't appear on the frontend immediately.

### Debugging & Logging

- **Enable Debug Mode:** When checked, the plugin will write detailed process information to a log file. This is an invaluable tool for diagnosing issues.
- **View Logs:** Opens a modal window to view the contents of the log file for a specific day. You can refresh, download, or clear the log files from this view.

## Product Settings

The "Product Settings" tab controls how discounts are displayed on your shop and single product pages.

### Product Page Display

- **Message Formats:** Customize the promotional messages that appear on a single product page for different campaign types (e.g., "You save {percentage_off}!"). You can use dynamic placeholders like `{percentage_off}`, `{amount_off}`, `{buy_quantity}`, and `{get_quantity}`.

- **Enable Quantity Discounts Table on Product Page:** When checked, a table outlining the tiered pricing for a "Quantity" campaign will be shown on the product page.
- **Customize Table:** Opens a modal window where you can customize the appearance of the Quantity Discount table, including its column titles and what content is shown.

### Product Exclusion & Prioritization

- **Handle Multiple Product Discounts:** This setting tells the plugin what to do when multiple campaigns could apply to the same product.
  - **Apply Highest Discount:** (Default) The plugin will apply only the campaign that gives the customer the biggest discount (lowest final price).
  - **Apply Lowest Discount:** The plugin will apply only the campaign that gives the customer the smallest discount.

## Cart Settings

The "Cart Settings" tab controls how discounts are displayed and interact with the WooCommerce cart.

![Cart Settings Tab](./public/settings-cart.png)

### Cart Page Display

- **Message Formats:** Customize the promotional messages displayed within the cart for different campaign types. For "Quantity" discounts, you can use placeholders like `{remaining_quantity_for_next_offer}` to create powerful upsell messages (e.g., "Add {remaining_quantity_for_next_offer} more and get {percentage_off}% off!").

### Cart Discount Options

- **Allow Stacking with WooCommerce Coupons:** When checked, your campaign discounts can be combined with standard WooCommerce coupons. If unchecked, the two systems are mutually exclusive.

- **Allow Stacking with Other Discount Campaigns:** This is one of the most powerful settings in the plugin. It controls whether different _types_ of CampaignBay campaigns (e.g., a Product-Level discount and a Cart-Level discount) can be applied together on the same product.
  - **If unchecked (default):** Only the single best overall discount will be applied to a product.
  - **If checked:** Discounts can be layered on top of each other in a specific order.

## Advanced Settings

The "Advanced Settings" tab contains settings for data management.

![Advanced Settings Tab](./public/settings-advanced.png)

- **Delete All Data on Uninstall:** This is a critical data management option.
  - **If unchecked (default):** When you uninstall the CampaignBay plugin, all your created campaigns and log data will be **kept** in the database. This is safe, as it prevents accidental data loss.
  - **If checked:** When you uninstall the plugin, a script will run to **permanently delete** all of its associated database tables and options. Only use this if you want to completely erase everything.
